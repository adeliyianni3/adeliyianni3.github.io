From this information, we designed the web application, the architecture and communication, and a 3D printed drone. We also focused on customer discovery and research, developing user stories as well as some user testing in creating mock ups of our UI with necessary features."

Over the course of the iterative sprints that spanned four months and with the changing needs of our client, our focus shifted from drone management in SAR operations to flight management on university campuses. With this goal in mind, we developed an application, where users can create missions, notifying the GTPD of flights, as well as allowing them to review flights for any risks or inconsistencies with FAA Guidelines."

The axes, which start at the center of the graph and radiates out, represent hours of the day, between 1 to 12, and the rings of the graph represent the days of the week starting with Sunday at the center and ending on Saturday. With all the circles plotted, lines are webbed through the points that share the same owner, creating the spider graph’s “star” based on the owner’s individual process in taking photos."
